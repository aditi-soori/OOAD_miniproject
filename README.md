Project Synopsis:
The Java Music Player is a software application designed to play and manage music files on a computer. The project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface to manage and play music files in different formats. The application will be developed using Java programming language and will use various libraries and frameworks to implement the features.

Features:
Music playback: The application will be able to play music files in different formats, such as MP3, WAV, FLAC, and others.
Playlists: Users can create and manage playlists to organize their music files.
Search: The application will allow users to search for music files based on different criteria, such as title, artist, album, or genre.
Equalizer: The music player will come with an in-built equalizer to allow users to adjust the sound quality.
User Interface: The application will have an intuitive and user-friendly interface with customizable options to suit the userâ€™s preferences.
Shuffle and Repeat: Users can shuffle tracks within a playlist or repeat a single track or entire playlist.
Search and Sort: The player provides a search function to quickly find desired tracks and sort options to organize playlists.


Project Implementation:
The Music Player project will be developed using Java programming language and will utilize various libraries and frameworks such as JavaFX for building the graphical user interface or alternatively, would be made a web application, Java Sound API for audio playback, and JDBC along with MySQL for managing the database. The application will have a modular design, with different modules for music playback, playlist management, search functionality, and equalizer.

The music player will be designed to work on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. The application will be developed using Agile methodology, with sprints of two weeks, where each sprint will involve adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving the existing functionalities.

The Java Music Player is a project that will provide an easy-to-use and efficient way of playing and managing music files on a computer. The project will help to improve the user experience by providing a feature-rich application with a simple interface.
